# Advent of Code
![AOC](aoc.PNG)

## All code all years
Having only discovered AoC in 2022, could not resist doing the back catalog.

## Challenge
First attempts in 2022 invovled using all the help I could get from 3rd party packages such as numpy and networkx.

So decided to undertake the back catalog by just using python 3.11 out the box, so no `requirements.txt` needed.

## Puzzle Data
Due to AoC intellectual property rights I have not included the example or my data in the repo.
If you like create a `.env` in the root with an enironment variable 

`AOC_DATA_PATH=<path to your data>`

The folder structure expected under it is year/day and within the day folder usually 2 files
for the exmaple and your data which should be named `ex.txt` and `my.txt`

```
data-root
├───2015
│   ├───day_01
│   ├───day_02
│   ├───day_03
```
