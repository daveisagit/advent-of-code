# Advent of Code

## All code all years
Having only discovered AoC in 2022, could not resist doing the back catalog

## Challenge
First attempts in 2022 invovled using all the help I could get from 3rd party packages such as numpy and networkx.
Decided to undertake the back catalog by just using python 3.11 out the box, so no requirements needed.

## Puzzle Data
Due to AoC intellectual property rights I have not included the example or my data in the repo.
